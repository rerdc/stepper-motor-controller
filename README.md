# Stepper Motor Controller
This DIY project focuses on developing a stepper motor controller, starting with the design of a control board for a single motor. The project will then expand to implement the CAN (Controller Area Network) protocol, enabling communication between multiple control boards and a central computer.

The central computer will function as the main controller for all boards within the CAN network, potentially featuring a GUI for sending commands and monitoring the system.

# Project Goal
The primary goal of this project is to deepen knowledge and practical skills in areas such as CAN communication, PCB design, and software development, with a focus on languages like C and Python.
